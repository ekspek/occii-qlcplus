# OCCII QLC+ configs

Testing out a new lighting controller for the [OCCII](occii.org) using QLC+ and an Ayra Digicon-1 MIDI controller. Configs go in here while I'm figuring QLC+ out and testing everything out during some shows.

## OCCII gear

Right now, everything's running using:
* My laptop with QLC+
* Ayra Digicon-1 MIDI controller
* ENTTEC DMX USB Pro DMX interface

Full list of fixtures is in the [OCCII lights manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSRjudncTyo6yV-CgUCgfpS6YHwomshKlq9XDRYOIAU) (also a WIP).

Other OCCII gear can be found [here](https://occii.org/tech-info/).
