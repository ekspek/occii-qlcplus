# Quick Start

To boot up the light system quickly:
1. Light up the stage lights with the corresponding switch.
2. In the light booth, ensure everything is well connected:
    * The console is powered on and connected to the laptop;

6. Select the *Inputs/Outputs* tab underneath and check that the console and the DMX output are detected, like below.
    * If the input (Ayra Digicon-1) is not detected, check the console power and connections, and reboot the program.
    * If the output (ENTTEC DMX Pro USB) is not detected, check the USB connection and unplug and replug if necessary, and reboot the program.

7. Select the **Virtual Console** tab underneath.

While the room may still be dark, the console is now operational! The **Virtual Console** on-screen should match the layout of the physical console itself, so for quick reference use this to know which buttons run which functions.

To turn on the lights, select a color for the stage using these buttons:
